				<p>At their core, Aries do things their own way. They are unafraid of 
				conflict, highly competitive, and honest. They throw themselves at the 
				world eagerly and without fear.</p>
				<p>Aries are driven by a desire to prove themselves and their strength. 
				They have high energy, and are competitive and ambitious. They naturally 
				take charge because they are good at initiating new projects. They can 
				also be impatient, but are naturally active and don’t like to waste time.
				<p>While Aries like competition, they don’t like to play games.
				They are highly self-aware, have strong opinions and are always ready to 
				defend them.</p>

				<br>
				<p>Leos are bold, warm, and loving. They are also the ultimate performers. 
				They can dazzle with the theatrical flair of a Broadway star and the 
				charisma of a politician. They are captivating personalities. No matter 
				how quickly they’ve just been introduced to a topic, they can speak 
				eloquently about almost anything because they have such a way with 
				words.</p>
				<p>Leos inject ambition into everything they do. 
				They are ruled by the heart. Their actions are natural and effortless 
				because they are brash and confident and trust their instincts.</P>
				<p>Leos have an unrelenting appetite for growth that is easily satiated 
				by the praise of others. When they are hurting, it shows. They will use 
				their anger as a protective wall to shield their vulnerabilities. They 
				want to be perceived as unbreakable because they are scared of admitting 
				vulnerability, needing things from other people, or being incomplete.</p>

				<h2> The Archer <h2>
				<h3>November 22 - December 20</h3>
				<br>
				<img src="Sagittarius-the-archer.JPG" height="400" alt="sagittarius the archer">
				<br>
				<p>Sagittarians are the ultimate empiricists. They will always choose 
				principles over feelings and will often question who they are. They move 
				from job to job, philosophy to philosophy, belief to belief. They are 
				explorers of the human condition and are unafraid of change. Sagittarians 
				feel like the world is their playground. They love to explore the unknown. 
				At their core, they want to understand how the world works.</p>
				<p>On an unbounded quest to discover the whole of the universe inside of 
				themselves, Sagittarians are unshackled from any particular worldly 
				attachment. They are reckless in their pursuit of what they want, and 
				often end up doing and experiencing things that defy conceptions of the 
				possible.</p>
				<p>Sagittarians are explorers. They are both the fearless adventurers and 
				the jaded critics. They understand that knowledge comes in two forms: the 
				shallow, disposable kind that comes from external sources, and the kind 
				that comes from within. Sagittarians know that external knowledge can be 
				easily gained while internal knowledge is exponentially deeper and more 
				powerful.</p>
